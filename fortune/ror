..and so he left, with everything but his humanity. He murmured something, faint, leaning against the body of
Providence, and silently nodded. That felt great. He was in pain, and in agony, but that felt great...

..and so he left, mutated beyond recognition. He slowly lurched around the enveloping bridge, trying to make
out the shapes that passed by. Snatched them out of the air like flies. He stared at his hand, fused into the
riot shield, and simply chanted- "I am better this way."

..and so he left, with his pyrrhic plunder. It sat, gasping in the cargo hold for air, wheezing for one last

the metal lie a simple janitor bot, riding a desecrated ship home. Where was home? Where was home now? And it
answered its own question.

..and so he left, never to become human again. He stared out of the window, trying to find interest in passing
stars. Quickly he swung his sword and the feelings were gone. All he had left was the blade. They will be
coming soon. They will be coming soon to rescue him, but all he had left was the blade.
